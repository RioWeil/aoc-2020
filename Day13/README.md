# Day13 Solution

This day's solution is incomplete. I was not able to generate an answer for part 2, though I have two methods that would work in theory. The first is a brute force search method which is simply too slow due to the exponential time complexity. The second approach uses the chinese remainder theorem to solve the system of congruences, but this seems to give an incorrect answer and I'm not sure where the bug is. I gave it my best shot!
